A computational simulation will be created in order to investigate the feasibility and compatibility of both modeling 
convection in three dimensions and modeling convection in three dimensions via investigating convection in two dimensions. 
This will be done using COMSOL, Python and possible Fortran for any numerical analysis that may be necessary. 
The goal associated with the computational aspect of the project will be to successfully model convection in two dimensions 
with the possibility of extending to three.
