#Experimental Setup#

For the purpose of this experiment we will use a transparent cylindrical vessel that is open on the top. The vessel will be filled with water at room temperature, using dissolved salts to vary the density of the fluid in order to produce a vertical density gradient. The temperature gradient necessary for convection will be driven by an ice bath in a thermally conductive container placed in contact with the surface of the fluid. A video camera will be used to record observation of the fluid dynamics. Adding dye to the fluid along with the salt water will allow for measurements of the density by using the dye as a proxy for density in images and video recordings. Variations in the velocity of the fluid can be observed and traced by using a rheoscopic fluid in the vessel in place of plain water. A motorized rotating table at a fixed angular velocity will be used to rotate the cylinder when investigating the effect of rotation on the convection.
